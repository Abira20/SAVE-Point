      @fly @noninteractive
      Imagine a planet in a circular orbit around the star. What would happen if you could change its speed?
    fixed:
      - You increased the speed a lot.
      - You decreased the speed a lot.
      - You changed the speed a little bit.
    options:
      - The planet would be ejected.
      - The planet would collide with the star.
      - The orbit would become elliptical (oval).

          You might want to practice this out a bit. How about taking the @icon-sandbox *Practice Mode* for a spin?
