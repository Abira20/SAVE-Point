          *@name*, it's your very first mission: just add one planet and make it orbit around the star!

          That's your first planet! Now try to *@icon-drag drag the planet*

          Awesome!  Lot of useful information about your planet is shown in the upper right, 
          such as its distance from the star, its speed, and the time it takes to orbit the star.

          Try it out!  @icon-drag *Drag the tip of the arrow* to change the speed
          and direction of the planet, and see its speed change in the upper right.

        message: |          
          As you change the position and speed of the planet, its orbital path will change.

          
          Now *tap on the @icon-star star* to let the planet orbit!

    subtitle: Make your planet collide with the star.
    win: Those were impressive fireworks!
    lose: You avoided crashing into the star.

    subtitle: Add a planet that escapes the pull of its star.
    win: Bye bye planet!
    lose: Oh no!  You're caught by the pull of gravity!

    subtitle: Add a planet in an elliptical (oval) orbit.
    win: So elliptical!
    lose: That orbit could be more elliptical...

  - title: Circular Orbit
    rule: nplanets > 0 && elements[0].eccentricity < 0.15 && elements[0].eccentricity > -0.001

    win: Sweet! That's... pretty circular!
    lose: That orbit is not very circular.

          A new type of mission!


          In this mission, your planet will have a *fixed speed (40 km/s)*
          and a *fixed direction* (perpendicular to the line connecting the star and the planet).

        message: |
          To win this mission, you will have to place the planet at just the right distance to get
          a circular orbit. 
    win: So circular!
    lose: The orbit was not quite circular... Try moving the planet to a different distance.

  - title: Speed vs. distance (25 km/s)
    subtitle: Add a planet in a circular orbit at 25 km/s.
    rule: nplanets > 0 && elements[0].eccentricity < 0.15 && elements[0].eccentricity > -0.001
