          Your very first mission: just add one planet and make it orbit around the star!

          That's your first planet! Now try to *@icon-drag drag the planet*
          to change its position.

        message: |
          Awesome!  Lot of useful information about your planet is shown in the upper right, 
          such as its distance from the star, its speed, and the time it takes to orbit the star.

          Try it out!  @icon-drag *Drag the tip of the arrow* to change the speed
          and direction of the planet, and see its speed change in the upper right.

        message: |          
          As you change the position and speed of the planet, its orbital path will change.

          
          Now *tap on the @icon-star star* to let the planet orbit!
